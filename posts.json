  "fullText": "<p>1. Background: The 9‑October Cease‑fire<br>On 9 October, Hamas and Israel signed an agreement that temporarily halted two years of intense fighting. The deal was hailed worldwide but left several thorny issues unresolved—particularly the administration of Gaza and the exchange of prisoners and remains. Despite the truce, each side has accused the other of violating its terms, undermining confidence in a lasting settlement.</p>\n\n<p>2. Recent Violations and Human Cost<br>Drone and Artillery Attacks: On 24 November, a drone fired a missile near Khan Younis, killing two Palestinians and wounding a third. A tank shell later struck east of Gaza City, killing one more.<br>Casualty Totals: Gaza’s Health Ministry reports that at least 342 Palestinians have been killed since the truce began on 10 October. Israel confirms the loss of three of its soldiers in the same period.<br>3. Hostage and Body Exchange Issues<br>Body of a Hostage Found: The armed wing of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad announced it had located the body of a hostage in an Israeli‑controlled area of Gaza. The timing of the handover remains unclear.<br>Remaining Bodies: The original truce called for 28 hostage bodies to be returned in exchange for 360 militant remains. Only three such bodies are still in Gaza.<br>4. International Negotiations and the Trump Plan<br>United Nations Endorsement: The UN Security Council formally backed President Donald Trump’s 20‑point plan, which proposes an interim, technocratic Palestinian government in Gaza overseen by an international “peace board” and supported by a multinational security force.<br>Implementation Challenges: Israel insists that the international force must disarm Hamas, while Hamas demands that Israeli troops stay away from Palestinian civilians. The composition, mandate, and deployment of this force remain undefined.<br>5. Mediators and Future Phases<br>Tony Blair’s Involvement: Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who helped craft the Trump plan, met with Deputy Leader Hussein al‑Sheikh of the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank to discuss self‑determination and the next steps.<br>Hamas‑Egypt Talks: A Hamas delegation led by Khalil al‑Hayya met Egyptian officials in Cairo to explore the second phase of the truce. Hamas has warned that Israeli violations are obstructing the agreement.<br>6. Obstacles to a Stable Agreement<br>Political Stalemate: Israel views a permanent peace only through Hamas’ complete surrender, while Palestinian factions reject any solution that leaves them without a recognized state.<br>Need for a Coherent Plan: Both sides point to the absence of a detailed, mutually acceptable security arrangement as the main hurdle to establishing a durable cease‑fire and rebuilding Gaza.<br>7. Looking Ahead<br>The truce remains fragile, with sporadic violations and unresolved political questions. A lasting resolution will require concrete, enforceable commitments, respect for both sides’ security concerns, and a clearly defined international framework to safeguard civilians and facilitate reconstruction.</p>"

  "title": "White House Power Play: Who Will Decide Ukraine’s Destiny?",
  "description": "The White House’s internal split—Vance’s pragmatic, “realist” approach versus Rubio’s hard‑line, NATO‑aligned stance—determines whether the U.S. pursues a negotiated settlement that could compromise Ukraine’s security or continues to support Kyiv’s sovereignty and NATO integration. The outcome will shape the future of Western alliances and Ukraine’s fate.",

  "fullText": "<p>1. Two Visions for Kyiv<br>Inside the Oval Office’s quiet corridors, Vice‑President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio have emerged as the country’s two most powerful advisers on Ukraine. Vance, the pragmatic “realist” of the administration, stresses the need to accept Russia’s battlefield advantage and seeks a negotiated settlement that would let Kyiv cede contested territory. Rubio, a long‑time hawk who famously branded Vladimir Putin a “gangster,” insists that the United States must back a hard‑line stance that keeps Ukraine aligned with NATO’s broader security network.</p>\n\n<p>2. The 28‑Point Proposal – A Russian‑Driven Draft<br>Last week, Vance took the lead by inviting President Volodymyr Zelensky to discuss the 28‑point plan that critics describe as a Russian “wish list.” The draft, prepared by the Trump‑appointed envoy Steve Witkoff and Russia’s top negotiator Kirill Dmitriev, would force Ukraine to abandon fortified positions in Donbas, limit the size of its armed forces, and bar the country from joining NATO. Although the plan was drafted largely behind closed doors, Vance’s endorsement gave it a veneer of White House approval.</p>\n\n<p>3. Rubio’s Counter‑Offensive in Geneva<br>When President Trump later said the 28‑point plan was not his “final offer,” Rubio stepped into the breach. He spent days negotiating with a Ukrainian delegation in Geneva, pushing back the most contentious demands. By Monday, the original 28 points had been trimmed to a 19‑point document, with the heaviest restrictions removed or postponed. European leaders applauded the softer approach, believing Rubio had become the administration’s primary Ukraine negotiator.</p>\n\n<p>4. A Parallel Peace Track<br>While Rubio pushed in Geneva, another arm of the White House continued to work on the Witkoff‑driven agenda. The dual processes—Rubio’s public negotiations and Witkoff’s secret meetings with Dmitriev—created confusion among senior advisers. A leaked call revealed Rubio calling the plan a “Russian proposal,” only to later claim it was an American‑crafted compromise that included input from both sides.</p>\n\n<p>5. Internal Turbulence and the Senate’s Role<br>Sources say the administration’s lack of a unified front has led to chaotic decision‑making. “Different parts of the White House don’t know what’s going on,” an insider told the Washington Post. The final deal will still need Senate approval, especially if it contains security guarantees or treaty‑level commitments. The split between Vance’s accommodationist approach and Rubio’s hard‑line stance has put the President in a dilemma: which vision will ultimately shape U.S. policy toward Ukraine?</p>\n\n<p>6. Looking Ahead – The Stakes for the Western Alliance<br>Ultimately, the outcome of this internal battle will decide whether the U.S. leans toward a negotiated peace that could weaken Ukraine’s future security or remains steadfast in its support for Kyiv’s sovereignty and alignment with NATO. The next few weeks will reveal whether President Trump can reconcile these competing priorities, or whether a single voice will emerge to dictate the country’s trajectory.</p>"
