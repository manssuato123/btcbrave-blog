  "fullText": "<p>Interviewer: Your journey has many layers. Who are you today, and what truly defines you?</p>\n\n<p>Manssuato:<br>Today, I see myself as a builder not only of projects, but of a future. I am a father of two daughters, a husband, a worker, an entrepreneur and a man who has learned, through pain and discipline, that nothing truly meaningful is ever easy. What defines me is not perfection, but persistence.</p>\n\n<p>The world often sees only the results. Few people see the nights of doubt, the pressure, the responsibility that weighs on your shoulders when you carry other lives in your hands. Being a father changes everything. When you look into your children’s eyes, excuses no longer exist. Only purpose remains.</p>\n\n<p>And it is not easy. None of it is easy.</p>\n\n<p>Interviewer: You often speak about strategy and organisation. Why are these so important to you?</p>\n\n<p>Manssuato:<br>Without strategy, effort becomes waste. Without organisation, even talent dissolves into chaos. I had to learn that the hard way.</p>\n\n<p>Life forced me to use strategy. Not just in business, but in survival, in planning, in protecting my family and in creating something meaningful from nothing. Every step I take has a reason. I don’t move randomly. I think, analyse, organise and then I act.</p>\n\n<p>I live by a simple rule: “We must be organised, we must be disciplined, and we must be intentional.”</p>\n\n<p>That is how goals are achieved. Not by luck. But by strategy and wisdom.</p>\n\n<p>Interviewer: You mentioned using strong phrases to stay focused. Can you share some of them?</p>\n\n<p>Manssuato:<br>Yes. I repeat certain phrases in my mind almost like a personal prayer, a mantra. Some of them are:</p>\n\n<p>• “Pressure creates diamonds.”<br>• “No one will build my future if I don’t.”<br>• “I don’t need motivation when I have responsibility.”<br>• “Chaos is the enemy of success.”<br>• “I was not created to give up.”</p>\n\n<p>And when things get heavy, when doubt tries to break in, I remember a powerful truth inspired by Abraham Lincoln:</p>\n\n<p>“I am a slow walker, but I never walk backwards.”</p>\n\n<p>That sentence is burned into my soul.</p>\n\n<p>Interviewer: How does being a father influence your decisions?</p>\n\n<p>Manssuato:<br>Being a father changed the way I see time. It made me understand that every minute matters. My daughters are the reason I wake up determined, even when I am tired. They are the reason I must stay strong when I feel weak.</p>\n\n<p>I don’t want them to see a man who gave up. I want them to see discipline, integrity and resilience. I want them to know that their father fought  with honour and intelligence.</p>\n\n<p>Nothing I do today is only for me. It is for them. It is legacy.</p>\n\n<p>And legacy is built through choices made under pressure.</p>\n\n<p>Interviewer: Abraham Lincoln is often mentioned as an inspiration to you. Why?</p>\n\n<p>Manssuato:<br>Because Lincoln represents a man who endured more than most, and yet refused to surrender his vision. He failed in business. He lost elections. He was mocked. But he stood firm in his purpose.</p>\n\n<p>That speaks directly to my own journey. Sometimes I fail. Sometimes I am misunderstood. Sometimes I feel alone. But I continue.</p>\n\n<p>Lincoln once said:</p>\n\n<p>“In the end, it’s not the years in your life that count, it’s the life in your years.”</p>\n\n<p>I live with that in mind. I don’t measure time. I measure impact.</p>\n\n<p>Interviewer: What message would you like people to take from your story?</p>\n\n<p>Manssuato:<br>That your past does not define your ceiling. Your discipline does.<br>That you do not need perfect conditions to start. You need courage.<br>That your struggles are not a curse  they are training.</p>\n\n<p>Above all, I want people to understand this:</p>\n\n<p>We must use strategy.<br>We must use wisdom.<br>We must stay organised.<br>And we must never lose focus on our objective.</p>\n\n<p>The world does not give space to the unprepared. But it bows to those who refuse to quit.</p>\n\n<p>Interviewer: Finally, what is your greatest strength today?</p>\n\n<p>Manssuato:<br>My mind.<br>My discipline.<br>My vision.</p>\n\n<p>And my daughters. They are both my weakness and my greatest power.</p>\n\n<p>Because a man with a reason is unstoppable.<br>And I have two.</p>"

  "fullText": "<p>BTCBRAVE Is Holding Its Ground Against Bearish Pressure</p>\n\n<p>In recent trading sessions, BTCBRAVE has demonstrated remarkable resilience, even as broader market sentiment has briefly leaned toward cautious or bearish territory. While some weaker hands have exited their positions, long-term holders and new strategic buyers have taken the opportunity to accumulate at a discount. This behaviour signals confidence rather than fear.</p>\n\n<p>Instead of collapsing under pressure, BTCBRAVE has formed a stable base — a typical sign seen before powerful upward movements.</p>\n\n<p>This phase is not a sign of weakness. On the contrary, it is what experienced traders recognise as “smart accumulation”.</p>\n\n<p>Strong Support Levels Are Forming</p>\n\n<p>One of the most important technical developments is the establishment of a solid support zone. Each time the price dips, it is met with immediate buying interest. This consistent response from the market indicates that investors see strong value in BTCBRAVE at this level.</p>\n\n<p>This type of action is usually seen when a token is preparing to reverse trend direction. Rather than free-falling, the price is carefully being defended, suggesting that larger players may be quietly positioning themselves before a major move.</p>\n\n<p>The market is speaking — and it is saying BTCBRAVE is not finished. It is getting ready.</p>\n\n<p>Momentum Is Building Behind the Scenes</p>\n\n<p>Even during periods of reduced volatility, internal momentum indicators reveal a different story. Volume patterns are starting to show signs of gradual increase, and the absence of panic selling points toward a potential supply squeeze.</p>\n\n<p>When too many sellers disappear, and demand begins to rise, price tends to move aggressively upward. This is basic market physics — and BTCBRAVE appears to be entering that exact stage.</p>\n\n<p>This is the calm before the breakout.</p>\n\n<p>Community Confidence Remains Strong</p>\n\n<p>One of BTCBRAVE’s greatest assets has always been its growing and loyal community. Despite temporary consolidation, interest in the project continues to increase across social channels.</p>\n\n<p>Engagement, wallet growth and brand recognition are slowly rising. That alone suggests something powerful is underway in the background. Most major movements in crypto are preceded by silence — followed by a sudden surge in visibility and volume.</p>\n\n<p>BTCBRAVE is positioning itself for precisely that moment.</p>"

  "fullText": "<p>1. Background: The 9‑October Cease‑fire<br>On 9 October, Hamas and Israel signed an agreement that temporarily halted two years of intense fighting. The deal was hailed worldwide but left several thorny issues unresolved—particularly the administration of Gaza and the exchange of prisoners and remains. Despite the truce, each side has accused the other of violating its terms, undermining confidence in a lasting settlement.</p>\n\n<p>2. Recent Violations and Human Cost<br>Drone and Artillery Attacks: On 24 November, a drone fired a missile near Khan Younis, killing two Palestinians and wounding a third. A tank shell later struck east of Gaza City, killing one more.<br>Casualty Totals: Gaza’s Health Ministry reports that at least 342 Palestinians have been killed since the truce began on 10 October. Israel confirms the loss of three of its soldiers in the same period.<br>3. Hostage and Body Exchange Issues<br>Body of a Hostage Found: The armed wing of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad announced it had located the body of a hostage in an Israeli‑controlled area of Gaza. The timing of the handover remains unclear.<br>Remaining Bodies: The original truce called for 28 hostage bodies to be returned in exchange for 360 militant remains. Only three such bodies are still in Gaza.<br>4. International Negotiations and the Trump Plan<br>United Nations Endorsement: The UN Security Council formally backed President Donald Trump’s 20‑point plan, which proposes an interim, technocratic Palestinian government in Gaza overseen by an international “peace board” and supported by a multinational security force.<br>Implementation Challenges: Israel insists that the international force must disarm Hamas, while Hamas demands that Israeli troops stay away from Palestinian civilians. The composition, mandate, and deployment of this force remain undefined.<br>5. Mediators and Future Phases<br>Tony Blair’s Involvement: Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who helped craft the Trump plan, met with Deputy Leader Hussein al‑Sheikh of the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank to discuss self‑determination and the next steps.<br>Hamas‑Egypt Talks: A Hamas delegation led by Khalil al‑Hayya met Egyptian officials in Cairo to explore the second phase of the truce. Hamas has warned that Israeli violations are obstructing the agreement.<br>6. Obstacles to a Stable Agreement<br>Political Stalemate: Israel views a permanent peace only through Hamas’ complete surrender, while Palestinian factions reject any solution that leaves them without a recognized state.<br>Need for a Coherent Plan: Both sides point to the absence of a detailed, mutually acceptable security arrangement as the main hurdle to establishing a durable cease‑fire and rebuilding Gaza.<br>7. Looking Ahead<br>The truce remains fragile, with sporadic violations and unresolved political questions. A lasting resolution will require concrete, enforceable commitments, respect for both sides’ security concerns, and a clearly defined international framework to safeguard civilians and facilitate reconstruction.</p>"

The outcome will shape the future of Western alliances and Ukraine’s fate.",

  "fullText": "<p>1. Two Visions for Kyiv<br>Inside the Oval Office’s quiet corridors, Vice‑President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio have emerged as the country’s two most powerful advisers on Ukraine. Vance, the pragmatic “realist” of the administration, stresses the need to accept Russia’s battlefield advantage and seeks a negotiated settlement that would let Kyiv cede contested territory. Rubio, a long‑time hawk who famously branded Vladimir Putin a “gangster,” insists that the United States must back a hard‑line stance that keeps Ukraine aligned with NATO’s broader security network.</p>\n\n<p>2. The 28‑Point Proposal – A Russian‑Driven Draft<br>Last week, Vance took the lead by inviting President Volodymyr Zelensky to discuss the 28‑point plan that critics describe as a Russian “wish list.” The draft, prepared by the Trump‑appointed envoy Steve Witkoff and Russia’s top negotiator Kirill Dmitriev, would force Ukraine to abandon fortified positions in Donbas, limit the size of its armed forces, and bar the country from joining NATO. Although the plan was drafted largely behind closed doors, Vance’s endorsement gave it a veneer of White House approval.</p>\n\n<p>3. Rubio’s Counter‑Offensive in Geneva<br>When President Trump later said the 28‑point plan was not his “final offer,” Rubio stepped into the breach. He spent days negotiating with a Ukrainian delegation in Geneva, pushing back the most contentious demands. By Monday, the original 28 points had been trimmed to a 19‑point document, with the heaviest restrictions removed or postponed. European leaders applauded the softer approach, believing Rubio had become the administration’s primary Ukraine negotiator.</p>\n\n<p>4. A Parallel Peace Track<br>While Rubio pushed in Geneva, another arm of the White House continued to work on the Witkoff‑driven agenda. The dual processes—Rubio’s public negotiations and Witkoff’s secret meetings with Dmitriev—created confusion among senior advisers. A leaked call revealed Rubio calling the plan a “Russian proposal,” only to later claim it was an American‑crafted compromise that included input from both sides.</p>\n\n<p>5. Internal Turbulence and the Senate’s Role<br>Sources say the administration’s lack of a unified front has led to chaotic decision‑making. “Different parts of the White House don’t know what’s going on,” an insider told the Washington Post. The final deal will still need Senate approval, especially if it contains security guarantees or treaty‑level commitments. The split between Vance’s accommodationist approach and Rubio’s hard‑line stance has put the President in a dilemma: which vision will ultimately shape U.S. policy toward Ukraine?</p>\n\n<p>6. Looking Ahead – The Stakes for the Western Alliance<br>Ultimately, the outcome of this internal battle will decide whether the U.S. leans toward a negotiated peace that could weaken Ukraine’s future security or remains steadfast in its support for Kyiv’s sovereignty and alignment with NATO. The next few weeks will reveal whether President Trump can reconcile these competing priorities, or whether a single voice will emerge to dictate the country’s trajectory.</p>"
